Texture is an interactive drawing machine that lets people feel the contours of objects around them, maps them to spirographic drawings, and transcribes them into AI-generated poetry. It does so by analyzing pressure data from a wearable device and mapping that data to the position of a servo on a turntable-like drawing machine. That data is also sent to OpenAI's ChatGPT API and prompted to compose a poem out of the changes in pressure data.
