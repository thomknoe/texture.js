# _Texture,_ 2024

Pine wood, stepper and servo motors, ink pens

Texture is an interactive drawing machine that lets people feel the contours of objects around them, maps them to spirographic drawings, and transcribes them into AI generated poetry. It does so by analyzing pressure data from a wearable device and maps that data to the position of a servo on a turn table-like, drawing machine. That data is also sent to OpenAI's ChatGPT API and prompted to compose a poem out of the changes in pressure data.
